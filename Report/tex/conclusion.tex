This chapter provides concluding remarks for the report - its summary and future work possibilities.

\section{Project Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
Throughout the course of this project, a system for data collection with surveys has been designed. The goal has been to provide means for researchers to easily and flexibly create, manage, distribute and, most importantly, re-use surveys and/or their parts. 
A system prototype has been implemented. The prototype consists of two parts - a domain specific language definition for the surveys and a smartphone app. The smartphone app is capable of loading a survey from a file, displaying it to the user, allowing for the questions to be answered and storing/displaying the completed surveys.

Despite of the simpleness of the prototype, it demonstrates feasibility of fulfilment of the aforementioned goal for the system. For example, the re-usability of the surveys is guaranteed by their design and the language for their specification. Xamarin framework has been used for the app implementation; this ensures cross-platformness of the app - the code can be compiled to work on all the major phone operating systems - Android, iOS and Windows.

There are, of course, many features desirable for the system which were not implemented in the prototype. These are briefly outlined in the next section.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
%TODO write about stuff (like survey graphical editor) from examples
%TODO suggest cooperation with one of existing solutions
% In the long run such an app should be able to obtain the survey definitions from a web server and transfer the results of the survey back to the web server. (copied from project definition)
% Phone sensors stuff
