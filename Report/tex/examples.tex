The final application will consist of two parts: user mobile application and editor desktop application.
The user application will display available surveys. The user can pick them and fill in, using the interface presented in the mockup image on the left. User is also able to read the previous survey answers and results.

The editor application allows creating a new survey. It contains three panels: toolbox/properties, source code and preview. It allows to build a survey by dragging and dropping its parts from a palette and also to define it by writing a text which adheres to a DSL.

A few example surveys are presented below.
\subsection{Health questionnaire}
%TODO add questionaire from DSL example.
The first survey is concerned with subjective health reporting on a weekly and daily basis. In this survey, the patient responds to a small questionnaire every day, and the survey is extended on a weekly basis to ask additional questions.\\\\
If a question is marked as ``mandatory'', it has to be answered before the next one is displayed.
In the first (daily) part, the following questions are asked:
A mandatory question: ``How are you feeling today''. The patient should choose a single number from 1 to 10.
Question only executed, if the 1.st question was answered with a value below 5. ``What is the reason of the discomfort (describe any factors which contributed to a low rating in the question number 1)'': The patient should answer in open text.
Question only executed, if the 1.st question was answered with a value below 5. ``Did you experience any of the following symptoms: Nausea, diarrhea, headache, other (open text)‚Äù. User should be able to choose any number of suggested answers and add an additional symptom, if not listed.
