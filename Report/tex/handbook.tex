When the app is started, the user is greeted with a simple home screen.

Here, the user can choose between two options: viewing surveys to be filled and completed surveys. Upon pressing on one of the buttons, the user is taken to the appropriate list of surveys.

In the completed survey list, the user can press on any survey in the list and its result will be displayed (currently merely as JSON text; conceivably in a different way in the final system).

In the surveys to be filled list, the user can again press on any survey in the list. In this case, the user will be allowed to begin filling the survey out. Filling the survey is done one question at a time.
