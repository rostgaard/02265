\section{Problem statement}
Surveys are commonly used in scientific studies as useful tool for collecting data to substantiate or reject theories. These surveys are historically done on paper, but along with the adoption of digital technologies, electronic surveys are becoming the standard.
Electronic surveys are, however, usually implemented ad-hoc with limited or no notion of neither the data they convey nor their relation to other surveys. This data-linking is to be done manually, and is tedious and time consuming. Another issue is that creating and re-deploying these surveys are usually a time-consuming process.
Streamlining and/or automating this process would clearly be beneficial for people relying on surveys for their data collection.
